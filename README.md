## Notes
- I am not a designer and while I enjoying building a slick, mobile responsive site, I wanted to put out this a v1. 
- This is an adopted version of my research at Microsoft in testing how performant the browser was in parsing exif data. Decided to do some ascii stuff from another project as well.
- Some work could be done on the state and representing that an image is in context and maintain that throughout routes. Will be something explored in later versions.
